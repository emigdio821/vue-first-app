# vue-first-app

This is just my first Vue app.
I recommend installing **Vue** using CLI ðŸ¤“.

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```
